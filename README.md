# EA-Mini-Hackathon
My team at EA Sports organized a mini hackathon to help build tools and write scripts to automate certain processes. 
The codebase that my team has a lot of asynchronous calls so I decided to code async iterators using a generator to help 
with async data and reduce the overload.  

To run the program, do the following:

`npm install node-fetch --save` to install node-fetch module


**Note
For the sake of my demo I had to push Node_modules.
